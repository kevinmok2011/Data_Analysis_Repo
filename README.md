# Data_Analysis_Repo
This is the exercise on using Pandas in Python and SQL query to analyze data from the DVD_Rental Database. The followings are the summary of this assignment - 
1. Create a time-series plot showing daily total revenue for three different countries with three countries in one plot (you will want matplotlib for this)
2. Carry out a sentiment analysis on movie descriptions adding another column to the data frame that provides a sentiment classification. This can be based on a “rules based system” that you coded OR inference from a LLM such as using the API for chatgpt.
3. Create a visual in the notebook that shows how much revenue is coming from different countries to the DVD store (you will want matplotlib).
4. Do an analysis to show which actors are bringing in the most revenue (top 10 ranked)
5. Create a new data-frame where you classify some different countries into some categories that make sense to you (8 countries min, 20 max) in this df there will be two columns, one column will give the country name, the other column will give the classification category.
6. Use an appropriate merge to merge that new data-frame from the last step with a dataframe from the dvd db, that gives the countries, so now countries are connected with their classification. (no need to add this table back to the postgresql db, just doing it in the notebook is fine)
